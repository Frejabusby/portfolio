            I like to create cool things with HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.
            It can be anything from a complete homepage to small features,
            and everything in between.

          <h3>Digital marketing</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked with Google Adwords, Google Analytics and Social Medias
            and thinks that marketing, in many aspects, are exciting.
            Itâ€™s super interesting to think from the user perspective.
            How will the user interact and use this content/product/thing.

          <h3>Illustrations</h3>
          <p>
            As a hobby I like to illustrate in Photoshop.
            It can be cards for birthdays, illustrations of animals or other objects.
